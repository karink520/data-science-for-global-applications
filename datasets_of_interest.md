# Project Check-in: Datasets of Interest

The goal of this check-in is to make progress on identifying several datasets that might be useful for your final project. You may want to re-read the rubric for the final project to keep in mind the expectations about what you will be creating.

For one (or two if you are having trouble deciding at this point) of the research questions that you suggested in your previous project check-in, do the following:

Identify at least two datasets that might be relevant to the question
Write a sentence or two about each of the datasets to explain what it is and why it might be useful to you (we will do a more extensive data audit later in the course).
Note: If you find you want to modify your research question from what you originally suggested, based on the feedback you received or available data, that is perfectly welcome as well.
