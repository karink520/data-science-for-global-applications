# Project Check-In: Draft Data Visualization

Please submit the following:

As a file upload, submit at least one draft data visualization as a .png or .jpg. file.  Your visualization should have a title and legend (if appropriate) and any axes should be clearly labeled.
Also, as a text submission, include a ~100 word caption to accompany your image.  This caption should be short, concise, and should help the reader understand the context and message of your visualization.  
Also, feel free to Include any programming questions you still have related to your visualization and we can try to answer them (i.e. why does my legend look like that? Why aren't my bars in descending order?)
Your visualization doesn't need to be in final form, but it needs to be at least complete enough to share with the class during our "gallery walk" in class.
